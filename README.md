**Final Project Proposal: Multipurpose Desktop**

_Description_:

Our project will be to create a small desktop like program. It will contain several programs, such as tic tac toe (3 by 3 version and an “ultimate” 9 by 9 version), lottery (similar to the one we did in class, but with more functionality), a calculator, a text editor, and “Letter Crush” (a play on to Candy Crush but with letters).


_Instructions_:
1. Compile:
'$javac MiniDesktop.java'

2. Run:
'$javac MiniDesktop.java'
