Final Project Proposal
Multipurpose Desktop

Our project will be to create a small desktop like program. It will contain several programs, such as tic tac toe (3 by 3 version and an “ultimate” 9 by 9 version with additional rules), lottery (similar to the one we did in class, but with more functionality), a calculator, a text editor, “Letter Crush” (a play on to Candy Crush but with letters), and other games if we have time.
